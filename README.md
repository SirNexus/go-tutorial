# goTutorial

This repository was created for my own benefit so that I can better understand the intricacies of how Go operates.
However, I hope that anyone that comes across it can get some sort of benefit from the processes I go through to understand
the different concepts and inner workings within GoLang.

I approach Go coming from a background in C/C++, so I will most likely be comparing the functionalities that work similarly
or highlight their differences.

Completed:
  * Slices
  * Maps
  * Interfaces
  
Interested/To Do:
  * Pointers
  * Polymorphism - more interfaces
